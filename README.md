# Shopping Web Scrapper
Web scrapper to keep track of prices, using Beautiful Soup.

### To do (Feb/20/18):
- [x] Import urls from a separate txt file, instead of placing them in main program.
- [ ] Reformat CSV to make price comparison easier by having product info be in columns, not rows.
- [ ] Only append name if file does not contain product name.
